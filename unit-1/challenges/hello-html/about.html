    <h2>Bingus</h2>
    <p>Bingus is a hairless Sphynx cat that originated from a video in which he is pet while staring at his owner. Attracting attention on Instagram in March 2020, Bingusâ€™ popularity exploded in September after he appeared in a viral Reddit post, which later resulted in online users referring to all Sphynxes as "Bingus."</p>
    <h2>Floppa</h2>

Originally circulated among ironic Instagram meme accounts starting in late December 2019, the meme gained more widespread popularity online starting in May 2020.</p>
    <h2>Froge</h2>
    <p>Mmmm Myes Pet Froge refers to a GIF caption of a frog being petted that inspired a series of similar GIF captions in early-to-mid 2020. A series of Twitch emotes known as PETTHE emotes depicting various subjects being petted began circulating in May 2020.</p>
